This is the text buffer implementation described in [Text Editor Data Structures](https://cdacamar.github.io/data%20structures/algorithms/benchmarking/text%20editors/c++/editor-data-structures/?fbclid=IwAR1KPqHQU-torrzSq7LKWgK3uUZsTaoEpiAQeDT8XlvlOD3MCSt3sEl2YXc).

## Building

If you're on Windows, open a developer command prompt and invoke `b.bat`.  Do the same for essentially any other compiler except change the flags to be specific to your compiler.  It's all standard C++ all the way down.
